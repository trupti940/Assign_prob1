Explore the picture element and define multiple sources for responsive images. Try to figure out how it can affect the web vitals score of the page.
ANS: The <picture> element in HTML allows you to define multiple sources for an image, enabling responsive images that can adapt to different screen sizes,
     resolutions, and conditions. This helps improve the user experience and can positively impact the web vitals score of a page by ensuring that the appropriate image is loaded for each specific scenario.

Explanation:
<picture> Element:

The <picture> element acts as a container for multiple <source> elements and one <img> element.
Each <source> element specifies a different image file and conditions for when that file should be used.
<source> Elements:

The srcset attribute of each <source> element specifies the image file to be used.
The media attribute specifies the media query condition for using the specified image.
<img> Element:

The <img> element is used as a fallback if none of the <source> conditions are met. It must always be the last child of the <picture> element.
The alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, improving accessibility.
Benefits for Web Vitals:
Using the <picture> element for responsive images can have a significant positive impact on web vitals, particularly in the following areas:

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):

Loading the appropriate image size for different devices and screen resolutions helps improve the LCP metric. Smaller images for mobile devices load faster, enhancing the user experience.
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):

Specifying the correct image dimensions and loading the appropriate image reduces layout shifts. This stability improves the CLS metric.
First Input Delay (FID):

While the <picture> element primarily affects LCP and CLS, it indirectly improves FID by ensuring that the page loads more efficiently and responds faster to user interactions.
